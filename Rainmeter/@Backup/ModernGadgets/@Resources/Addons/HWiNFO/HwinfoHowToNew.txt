HOW TO CONFIGURE HWINFO SENSORS

Note: This information is also contained in the setup tutorial viewed through the setup skin.

ModernGadgets uses HWiNFO to monitor a very wide range of information, most specifically for monitoring the GPU. However, before it will work, it
needs to be set up properly. Every sensor in HWiNFO has three values to identify it: The Sensor ID, the Sensor Instance, and the Entry ID. These
values are in hexadecimal format, and tells the HWiNFO plugin which sensor you want. To begin, open the HWiNFO Shared Memory Viewer (SMV) application
by clicking the corresponding button in the config skin.

An Explanation of the HWiNFO Config Screen

You will see several sections along the top named "CPU0" and the like. These correspond to different Sensor ID sections in the SMV. For example,
on my system the CPU0 section is named "CPU [#0]: Intel Core i7-6700". It's not very difficult to figure out which sections in the SMV correspond
to which sections in the config skin, but if you have issues, just keep trying. If you cannot find a certain section, it means you don't have that
sensor on your system and you're out of luck!

You may notice that there are several CPU0 sections.
